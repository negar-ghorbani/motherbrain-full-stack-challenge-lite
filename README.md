# Motherbrain Full Stack Challenge

1. Fork this repo.
2. Run `yarn install` and `yarn dev` in the `backend` and `frontend` folders respectively.

## The Challenge

This repository is a barebones setup with a Node backend and a React frontend. If you really want to, you can tear it all down and start from scratch, but this is meant to get you started immediately.

### Notes

Consider installing Prisma extension in your IDE/editor to simplify working with the `schema.prisma` file.
